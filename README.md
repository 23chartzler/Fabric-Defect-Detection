# AI Fabric Defect Detection System

This project implements a **real-time fabric defect detection system** using computer vision and AI.  
It integrates a live camera feed, an AI model (YOLOv8n), and a web interface to visualize and save predictions.

## ⭐ Features

- Real-time detection using **YOLOv8n**
- Detects:
  - Holes
  - Seams
  - Stains
  - Loose Threads
  - Warp/Weft Defects
  - No Defect
- Live camera preview with overlays
- Adjustable camera settings:
  - Resolution
  - Image format
  - Recording duration
  - Photos per second (FPS)
- Saves:
  - Raw images
  - YOLO bounding box labels
- Live monitoring:
  - FPS
  - Photo count
  - Total recording time
  - Folder size
